# StageXL 

StageXL is a fast and universal 2D rendering engine for HTML5 and Dart. 
It provides a wide range of features for 2D games or other graphically 
rich content. The WebGL based engine is highly optimized to reduce the
number of draw calls sent to the GPU and therefore delivers top-class
performance. The automatic fallback to a Canvas2D based engine guarantees 
compatibility with older browsers or legacy hardware. 

Some of the features provided by StageXL are: texture atlas support, 
draw call batching, pixel masking, pixel filters, pixel blending,
texture filtering, hierarchical display list, sprite sheet animations, 
rich animation framework, audio and video support, interaction events,
3D transformations of 2D objects, resource management, text rendering 
and many more features as well as extensibility for even more features.

## Extension Libraries

StageXL provides a rich set of built-in features. Even more advanced use cases 
may require an extension library with a specialised set of features. The number
of extension libraries is growing over time, here is a list of the most popular

## Adobe Flash heritage

StageXL started as an easy migration path for Adobe Flash developers and their
products to HTML5. Therefore StageXL provides the same display list API you
may have used for many years in Flash. Furthermore the Dart programming
language is easy to use for everyone who is familiar with ActionScript.
